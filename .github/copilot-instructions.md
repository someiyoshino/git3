# Copilot Instructions for git3 Repository

## Repository Overview

This is a Git practice repository (`git3`) used for learning and testing Git operations, branching strategies, and GitHub workflows. The repository contains sample markdown files organized in different directories to simulate a realistic project structure.

## Repository Structure

- `main.md` - Main branch documentation file (in Japanese)
- `Sample.md` - Sample file for testing changes and pull requests
- `t1/`, `t2/`, `t3/` - Test directories containing test markdown files
- `f3/`, `f4/` - Feature directories
- Various `.txt` files - Simple text files for testing

## Project Purpose

This repository is primarily used for:
- Learning Git branching and merging workflows
- Testing pull request processes
- Practicing issue tracking and resolution
- Understanding Git operations in a safe environment

## Language

The repository uses Japanese language in its documentation and commit messages. When making changes:
- Maintain consistency with existing Japanese documentation when appropriate
- Comments and issue descriptions may be in Japanese or English

## Guidelines for Changes

### When Working on Issues:
1. **Scope**: Keep changes minimal and focused on the specific issue
2. **Testing**: This is a practice repository, so formal testing is not required
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant markdown files if changes affect documentation
4. **Branch Strategy**: Follow the existing branch naming conventions (e.g., `copilot/*`, feature branches)

### File Modifications:
- Markdown files (`.md`) are the primary content
- Text files (`.txt`) are used for simple testing
- Preserve Japanese language content unless explicitly asked to change it

### Commits:
- Keep commits small and focused
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Follow the existing commit style in the repository

## Build and Test

This repository does not have build processes or automated tests. Changes can be verified by:
1. Reviewing the markdown rendering
2. Checking file content is correct
3. Ensuring no unintended files are modified

## Dependencies

This repository has no external dependencies or package managers.

## Notes

- This is a learning/practice repository, so perfect code is not expected
- Focus on understanding Git workflows rather than production-quality code
- Experimental changes are welcome in feature branches
